# Equitable

Equitable is a Solidity-based smart contract designed to implement a multi-dimensional inter-subjective valuation system in a collaborative environment. Its core functionality revolves around creating voting rounds wherein each participant (voter) can assess others based on a set of weighted criteria. The computed ranks (and therefore, the points) are then assigned to each participant, enabling various use cases.


## Potential use cases

The *Equitable* contract can be effectively used in a wide array of scenarios, including, but not limited to:

- Collaborative Decision Making: Organizations can use the system to involve team members in decision-making processes, promoting an equitable culture.

- Performance Evaluation: Teams can assess individual performance based on multiple criteria, and the contract can help automate the ranking and reward allocation.

- Resource Allocation: In DAOs or other democratic entities, the contract can be used to decide on the distribution of resources based on collective agreement.

- Peer Reviews: The contract allows for a structured peer review system where each member can evaluate others based on specified criteria.


## Current Status

As of now, the *Equitable* contract is a work in progress. The core functionalities are being actively developed, and comprehensive testing is being carried out to ensure its robustness and security.

Please note: As Equitable is a financial tool handling potentially large amounts of value, a formal verification of the smart contract should be considered once it reaches a more mature stage, to ensure correctness of its implementation and prevent potential security risks.
